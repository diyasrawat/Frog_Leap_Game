# Frog_Leap_Game
The Frog Leap Puzzle Game is a console-based Python implementation of a classic puzzle where two sets of frogs, one green and one brown, are placed on opposite sides of a river. The objective is to swap the positions of the green and brown frogs using specific movement rules until they are in the opposite arrangement.
